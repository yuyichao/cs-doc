<h3 class="docSection1Title">5.5. Spinlocks</h3>

<p class="docText">Semaphores are a useful tool for mutual exclusion,<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5018"></a>
but they are not the only such tool provided by the kernel. Instead,
most locking is implemented with a mechanism called a
<i>spinlock</i>. Unlike semaphores, spinlocks may be
used in code that cannot sleep, such as interrupt handlers. When
properly used, spinlocks offer higher performance than semaphores in
general. They do, however, bring a different set of constraints on
their use.</P>

<p class="docText">Spinlocks are simple in concept. A spinlock is a mutual exclusion
device that can have only two values:
"locked" and
"unlocked." It is usually
implemented as a single bit in an integer value. Code wishing to take
out a particular lock tests the relevant bit. If the lock is
available, the "locked" bit is set
and the code continues into the critical section. If, instead, the
lock has been taken by somebody else, the code goes into a tight loop
where it repeatedly checks the lock until it becomes available. This
loop is the "spin" part of a
spinlock.</P>

<p class="docText">Of course, the real implementation of a spinlock is a bit more
complex than the description above. The "test and
set" operation must be done in an atomic manner so
that only one thread can obtain the lock, even if several are
spinning at any given time. Care must also be taken to avoid
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5019"></a>deadlocks
on
<I>hyperthreaded</i><a name="chp-5-ITERM-5020"></a>
processors—chips that implement multiple, virtual CPUs sharing
a single processor core and cache. So the actual spinlock
implementation is different for every architecture that Linux
supports. The core concept is the same on all systems, however, when
there is contention for a spinlock, the processors that are waiting
execute a tight loop and accomplish no useful work.</P>

<p class="docText">Spinlocks are, by their nature, intended for use on multiprocessor
systems, although a uniprocessor workstation running a preemptive
kernel behaves like SMP, as far as concurrency is concerned. If a
nonpreemptive uniprocessor system ever went into a spin on a lock, it
would spin forever; no other thread would ever be able to obtain the
CPU to release the lock. For this reason, spinlock operations on
uniprocessor systems without preemption enabled are optimized to do
nothing, with the exception of the ones that change the IRQ masking
status. Because of preemption, even if you never expect your code to
run on an SMP system, you still need to implement proper locking.</P>

<a name="chp-5-sect-5.1"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.1. Introduction to the Spinlock API</h4>

<p class="docText">The required include file for
the<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5021"></a>
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5022"></a>
spinlock <a name="chp-5-ITERM-5023"></a>primitives is
<i>&lt;linux/spinlock.h&gt;</i>. An actual lock has the
type <tt>spinlock_t</tt>. Like any other data structure, a
spinlock must be initialized. This initialization may be done at
compile time as follows:</P>

<pre>spinlock_t my_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;</pre><br>


<p class="docText">or at runtime with:</p>

<pre>void spin_lock_init(spinlock_t *lock);</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Before entering a critical section, your code must obtain the
requisite lock with:</p>

<pre>void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock);</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Note that all spinlock waits are, by their nature, uninterruptible.
Once you call <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock</span>, you will spin until the
lock becomes available.</P>

<p class="docText">To release a lock that you have obtained, pass it to:</p>

<pre>void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock);</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">There are many other spinlock functions, and we will look at them all
shortly. But none of them depart from the core idea shown by the
functions listed above. There is very little that one can do with a
lock, other than lock and release it. However, there are a few rules
about how you must work with spinlocks. We will take a moment to look
at those before getting into the full spinlock interface.</p>


<a name="chp-5-sect-5.2"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.2. Spinlocks and Atomic Context</h4>

<p class="docText">Imagine for a moment that your<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5024"></a> driver acquires a spinlock and goes
about its business within its critical section. Somewhere in the
middle, your driver loses the processor. Perhaps it has called a
function (<span class="docEmphasis">copy_from_user</span>, say) that puts the
process to sleep. Or, perhaps, kernel preemption kicks in, and a
higher-priority process pushes your code aside. Your code is now
holding a lock that it will not release any time in the foreseeable
future. If some other thread tries to obtain the same lock, it will,
in the best case, wait (spinning in the processor) for a very long
time. In the worst case, the system could deadlock entirely.</p>

<p class="docText">Most readers would agree that this scenario is best avoided.
Therefore, the core rule that applies to spinlocks is that any code
must, while holding a spinlock, be atomic. It cannot sleep; in fact,
it cannot relinquish the processor for any reason except to service
interrupts (and sometimes not even then).</p>

<p class="docText">The kernel preemption case is handled by the spinlock code itself.
Any time kernel code holds a spinlock, preemption is disabled on the
relevant processor. Even uniprocessor systems must disable preemption
in this way to avoid race conditions. That is why proper locking is
required even if you never expect your code to run on a
multiprocessor machine.</p>

<p class="docText">Avoiding sleep
while<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5025"></a>
holding a lock can be more difficult; many kernel functions can
sleep, and this behavior is not always well documented. Copying data
to or from user space is an obvious example: the required user-space
page may need to be swapped in from the disk before the copy can
proceed, and that operation clearly requires a sleep. Just about any
operation that must allocate memory can sleep;
<span class="docEmphasis">kmalloc</span> can decide to give up the processor, and
wait for more memory to become available unless it is explicitly told
not to. Sleeps can happen in surprising places; writing code that
will execute under a spinlock requires paying attention to every
function that you call.</p>

<p class="docText">Here's another scenario: your driver is executing
and has just taken out a lock that controls access to its device.
While the lock is held, the device issues an interrupt, which causes
your interrupt handler to run. The interrupt handler, before
accessing the device, must also obtain the lock. Taking out a
spinlock in an interrupt handler is a legitimate thing to do; that is
one of the reasons that spinlock operations do not sleep. But what
happens if the interrupt routine executes in the same processor as
the code that took out the lock originally? While the interrupt
handler is spinning, the noninterrupt code will not be able to run to
release the lock. That processor will spin forever.</p>

<p class="docText">Avoiding this trap requires disabling interrupts (on the local CPU
only) while the spinlock is held. There are variants of the spinlock
functions that will disable interrupts for you
(we'll see them in the next section). However, a
complete discussion of interrupts must wait until <a class="docLink" href="chp-10.shtml#chp-10">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

<p class="docText">The last important rule for spinlock usage is that spinlocks must
always be held for the minimum time possible. The longer you hold a
lock, the longer another processor may have to spin waiting for you
to release it, and the chance of it having to spin at all is greater.
Long lock hold times also keep the current processor from scheduling,
meaning that a higher priority process—which really should be
able to get the CPU—may have to wait. The kernel developers put
a great deal of effort into reducing kernel latency (the time a
process may have to wait to be scheduled) in the 2.5 development
series. A poorly written driver can wipe out all that progress just
by holding a lock for too long. To avoid creating this sort of
problem, make a point of keeping your lock-hold times short.</p>


<a name="chp-5-sect-5.3"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.3. The Spinlock Functions</h4>

<p class="docText">We have already seen two
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5026"></a>functions,
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">spin_unlock</span>,
that manipulate spinlocks. There are several other functions,
however, with similar names and purposes. We will now present the
full set. This discussion will take us into ground we will not be
able to cover properly for a few chapters yet; a complete
understanding of the spinlock API requires an understanding of
interrupt handling and related concepts.</p>

<p class="docText">There are actually four functions that can lock a spinlock:</P>

<pre>void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock);
void spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void spin_lock_irq(spinlock_t *lock);
void spin_lock_bh(spinlock_t *lock)</pre><br>


<p class="docText">We have already seen how <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock</span> works.
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_irqsave</span> disables interrupts (on the
local processor only) before taking the spinlock; the previous
interrupt state is stored in <tt>flags</tt>. If you are
absolutely sure nothing else might have already disabled interrupts
on your processor (or, in other words, you are sure that you should
enable interrupts when you release your spinlock), you can use
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_irq</span> instead and not have to keep track
of the flags. Finally, <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_bh</span> disables
software interrupts before taking the lock, but leaves hardware
interrupts enabled.</P>

<p class="docText">If you have a spinlock that can be taken by code that runs in
(hardware or software) interrupt context, you must use one of the
forms of <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock</span> that disables interrupts.
Doing otherwise can deadlock the system, sooner or later. If you do
not access your lock in a hardware interrupt handler, but you do via
software interrupts (in code that runs out of a tasklet, for example,
a topic covered in <a class="docLink" href="chp-7.shtml#chp-7">Chapter 7</a>),
you can use <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_bh</span> to safely avoid
deadlocks while still allowing hardware interrupts to be serviced.</P>

<p class="docText">There are also four ways to<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5027"></a>
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5028"></a>
release a spinlock; the one you use must correspond to the function
you used to take the lock:</p>

<pre>void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock);
void spin_unlock_irqrestore(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void spin_unlock_irq(spinlock_t *lock);
void spin_unlock_bh(spinlock_t *lock);</pre><br>


<p class="docText">Each <span class="docEmphasis">spin_unlock</span> variant undoes the work
performed by the corresponding <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock</span>
function. The <tt>flags</tt> argument passed to
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_unlock_irqrestore</span> must be the same variable
passed to <span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_irqsave</span>. You must also call
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_lock_irqsave</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">spin_unlock_irqrestore</span> in the same function;
otherwise, your code may break on some architectures.</p>

<p class="docText">There is also a set of nonblocking spinlock
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5029"></a>
<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5030"></a>operations:</P>

<pre>int spin_trylock(spinlock_t *lock);
int spin_trylock_bh(spinlock_t *lock);</pre><br>


<p class="docText">These functions return nonzero on success (the lock was obtained),
<tt>0</tt> otherwise. There is no
"try" version that disables
interrupts.</P>


<a name="chp-5-sect-5.4"></a>
<H4 class="docSection2Title">5.5.4. Reader/Writer Spinlocks</H4>

<p class="docText">The kernel provides a<a name="chp-5-ITERM-5031"></a> reader/writer form of spinlocks that
is directly analogous to the reader/writer semaphores we saw earlier
in this chapter. These locks allow any number of readers into a
critical section simultaneously, but writers must have exclusive
access. Reader/writer locks have a type of
<tt>rwlock_t</tt>, defined in
<i>&lt;linux/spinlock.h&gt;</i>. They can be declared
and initialized in two ways:</p>

<pre>rwlock_t my_rwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED; /* Static way */

rwlock_t my_rwlock;
rwlock_init(&amp;my_rwlock);  /* Dynamic way */</pre><br>


<p class="docText">The list of functions available should look reasonably familiar by
now. For readers, the following functions are available:</P>

<pre>void read_lock(rwlock_t *lock);
void read_lock_irqsave(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void read_lock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
void read_lock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);

void read_unlock(rwlock_t *lock);
void read_unlock_irqrestore(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void read_unlock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
void read_unlock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Interestingly, there is no <span class="docEmphasis">read_trylock</span>.</P>

<p class="docText">The functions for write access are similar:</p>

<pre>void write_lock(rwlock_t *lock);
void write_lock_irqsave(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void write_lock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
void write_lock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);
int write_trylock(rwlock_t *lock);

void write_unlock(rwlock_t *lock);
void write_unlock_irqrestore(rwlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags);
void write_unlock_irq(rwlock_t *lock);
void write_unlock_bh(rwlock_t *lock);</pre><BR>


<p class="docText">Reader/writer locks can starve readers <a name="chp-5-ITERM-5032"></a>just as rwsems can. This behavior is
rarely a problem; however, if there is enough lock contention to
bring about starvation, performance is poor anyway.</P>
